Teleport's access request plugins must authenticate to your Teleport cluster as
a user with a Teleport role that has permissions to list, read, and update
access requests. This way, plugins can retrieve access requests from the
Teleport Auth Service, present them to reviewers, and modify them after a
review.

Define a non-interactive user and role called `access-plugin` by adding the
following content to a file called `access-plugin.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: user
metadata:
  name: access-plugin
spec:
  roles: ['access-plugin']
version: v2
---
kind: role
version: v4
metadata:
  name: access-plugin
spec:
  allow:
    rules:
      - resources: ['access_request']
        verbs: ['list', 'read', 'update']
      - resources: ['access_plugin_data']
        verbs: ['update']
```

Create the user and role:

```code
$ tctl create -f access-plugin.yaml
```
